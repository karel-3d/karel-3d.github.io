description: Killing browser with onbeforeunload

There is a cool way to make your browser unresponsive and in some cases crash the entire OS

Just add this peace of code to your website and make the user reload it or close it

     window.onbeforeunload = function () {
       while (true) {
         console.log("AAAA");
       }
     }; 

 
[An example here](http://www.karelbilek.com/reload_death.html).

My experience on Linux:

* Chrome handles it sort-of well, shows "kill page" after a while
* However, with open developer console, it makes entire browser unresponsive and, in one case, it crashed entire OS and I had to hard-reboot it
* Mac OS X seems to handle this sligthly better, but I have no way to test it thoroughly
* I don't have a Windows computer so I can't try it on Win / IE
