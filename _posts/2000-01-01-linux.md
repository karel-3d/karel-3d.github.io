Random notes that I want to remember for using Linux. Just to not forget them.

Complex bash history
---
I always find the concept of `history` (and Ctrl-R) a bit confusing, especially when using multiple windows, multiple screens, and so on. So, I got a little script, copied from [OndÅ™ej Bojar](http://www1.cuni.cz/~obo/) and edited a bit.

---

First, install gawk (`apt-get install gawk`).

Then, add this to `~/.bashrc`:
    
    myHistory() {
        history 1 | awk '($2 !~ "^[mr]?cd[0-9a-z]?$") {$1="_T="strftime("%Y%m%d_%H:%M:%S_") PROCINFO["ppid"] "_PWD="  ENVIRON["PWD"] "\t"; $2=gensub("^_T=[-_0-9:]*[ \t]* *", "", 1, $2); $2=gensub("^_P=[^ \t]* *", "", 1, $2); print;}' >> ~/.complex_bash_history
    }
    export PROMPT_COMMAND="myHistory"
    alias ahistory='less ~/.complex_bash_history'
    alias lhistory='grep "_PWD=$PWD\s" ~/.complex_bash_history | less'


`ahistory` now displays all history, `lhistory` history in current directory; it's possible to grep it further, since less will just behave as `cat` when in pipe

PS1
---
To .bashrc:

    export PS1="\h | \t | \w\$ "

or, for manual name:

    export PS1="name | \t | \w\$ "

Head and tails off-by-one 
---

I will assume numbering of lines starts at 1, not 0.

- `head -n 4` will print everything from line 1 to line 4.
- `tail -n +4` will print everything from 4 onwards, *including 4*.
- so, if you do `head -n 4`, you will need to do `tail -n +5` if you want the rest
- if you want first `N` lines for something, the next `M` lines for something else, and then the rest to something else, you have to do
    - `cat original | head -n N | firstthing`
    - `cat original | head -n (N+M) | tail -n M | secondthing`
    - `cat original | tail -n +(N+M+1) | thirdthing`
